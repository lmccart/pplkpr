pplkpr is an app that tracks, analyzes, and auto-manages your relationships. Using a [smartwatch](http://mioglobal.com), pplkpr monitors your physical and emotional response to the people around you, and optimizes your social life accordingly.

pplkpr uses GPS and a heart rate wristband to keep track of when you're coming and going, and when you're feeling emotional. pplkpr implements a complex metric called "heart rate variability" that uses subtle changes in heart rhythm to determine your emotional state. This data is correlated with the people you interact with to determine who should be auto-scheduled into your life and who should be removed.

pplkpr was created by [Lauren McCarthy](http://lauren-mccarthy.com) and [Kyle McDonald](http://kylemcdonald.net) to explore the implications of quantified living for relationships. Who owns the data created between two people, what if it is captured and used? What if algorithms could understand our relationships and suggest better interpersonal decisions than we can make ourselves?
